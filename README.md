# Hello, I'm Ethan R.

## About me

I'm a Year 12 student from the UK who is passionate about building and understanding the mechanisms of artificial intelligence. I'm mostly intersted by the theory behind deep learning and enjoy implemnting algorithms from the ground up.

I mainly focus on:
-  Implementing deep learning algorithms **without external ML libraries**
-  Understanding the **mathematics** behind deep learning models

## Featured Projects

Here are the projects I'm most proud of, which represents my journey into AI.

| Project | Description | Key Highlights|
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **[From Scratch Deep Learning Library](https://github.com/EthanR168/QuackNet)** | A modular, unit tested library built using NumPy. | <ul><li> Built NN, CNN, RNN, and Transformer modules </li><li> Used to train a CNN on HAM10000</li></ul> |
| **[Custom Autograd Engine](https://github.com/EthanR168/QuackGrad)** | A PyTorch like automatic differntiation engine. | <ul><li> Supports forward/backward pass </li><li> Implements the chain rule for gradients </li></ul> |
| **[CNN Kernal Transformation]()** | An exmperiment into the effects of various transformations on CNN kernal weights during training. | <ul><li> Compared Sin, Linear Mapping, Sinusoidal Positioning, Square Root tranforms </li><li> Analysed effects on accuracy, loss and weight evolution </li></ul>|
| **[Matrix Multiplication Benchmark](https://github.com/EthanR168/matrixBenchmark)** | An implementation and performance analysis of naive, Strassen, and Winograd matrix multiplication algorithms. | <ul><li> Implemented recursive algorithms </li><li> Created a hybrid version with a custom cutoff </li><li> Benchmarked for runtime, numerical stability and TFLOPS |
| **[Skin Lesion Classifier](https://github.com/EthanR168/skinLesionDetector)** | A CNN based classifier trained on the HAM10000 dataset using QuackNet. | <ul><li> Demonstrates QuackNet in practical use</li></ul> |
